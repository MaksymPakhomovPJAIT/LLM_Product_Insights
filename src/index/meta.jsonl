I had to be careful with that combo though. It did a great job at stripping my hair clean, but if I used it too often, it absolutely wrecked my scalp. I now have softened water, and I pair the CeraVe shampoo with L'Oreal's Curl Conditioner or L'Oreal's Restore Conditioner (aka their hard water conditioner) and that's been working very well for me.

Its thick consistency out of the bottle does make it harder to spread all over my hair, and it doesn't quite feel like it leaves my hair truly clean.
