1,5,"Great Value, Trusted Quality ‚Äì My Go-To for a Healthy Scalp!","I've been using the Head & Shoulders Shampoo and Conditioner Set for years, and it never disappoints. This set is a fantastic value‚Äîyou get both products for a very affordable price, especially compared to buying them separately at the store.The quality is top-notch. The shampoo cleans thoroughly without drying out my scalp, and the conditioner leaves my hair soft, manageable, and never greasy. It‚Äôs one of the few products that actually helps prevent flakes and itch while still making your hair feel and smell great.This set is a staple in our home‚Äîit works for the whole family, and it‚Äôs perfect for daily use. If you‚Äôre looking for an effective, affordable, and reliable hair care solution, this is it. Highly recommend!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NXMXOF5QLIMR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
1,5,Great for my locs,"Great shampoo, no itch. Cooling and tingly sensation. Continuous use of at least twice a week and flakes will go away forever.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UA0W16VJQNE7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
1,5,Shampoo- Great Deal!,"Works exactly as expected-reliable, clean scent, and keeps dandruff under control. The twin pack is a great value and lasts a long time. Came nicely packaged. No Leaks.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KOS0ZYXE2KV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
1,5,Best shampoo ever,"About 2 years ago I started having an itchy scalp. Never had this ever before. This shampoo did the trick. Who knew Head & Shoulders was such a great product. This shampoo smells great - very fresh. It is thick and leaves my hair feeling thick and great and clean. I will never go back to expensive salon shampoos. I follow up with a Klorane plant based purple conditioner but this is only to brighten my grays. H&S leaves my hair feeling great if I don't use conditioner but I like the brightness the purple conditioner brings to my gray.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDGKK8X06K6IO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
1,5,Excellent product.,"No more itchy scalp.Not harsh.Nice price point vs retail.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCPLQNJV8UD16/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
1,4,"Great for dry hair, but not for oily scalp","This shampoo works really well if you have dry or damaged hair ‚Äî it leaves my hair feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. The scent is nice but not overpowering, and a little goes a long way. That said, if you have an oily scalp like I do, it might not be the best fit. I noticed my hair got greasy faster than usual. I think it‚Äôs better suited for people with dry or frizzy hair who need extra moisture.Overall, it‚Äôs a great product ‚Äî just depends on your hair type!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P9PJ9C0OV6ZW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
2,5,GREAT product!!,"Only washed my hair with it once. But Holy Moly!! What a great job it did with my hair. It was dry and brittle beforehand. One wash and it feels like it was freshly washed and cut. No more brittle ends. Can‚Äôt wait to see what it‚Äôll be like after a few more washes.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R60UBZYMP7CXR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
2,5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought both the Dove 'daily moisture' shampoo and the Dove 'daily moisturizer' conditioner. I chose this specific formula because I have thick, wavy hair that gets quite dry - and this line (according to the product description) is 'designed for dry hair.'PROS - the pumps make for easy dispensing of both the shampoo & the conditioner. The conditioner is easy to distinguish from the shampoo because it has a gold band along the pump's top. The scent of both products is fresh and clean but not overpowering. My hair felt well-moisturized and did lay slightly softer than normal once it was air-dried. The price is amazing. The amount of product you get for the price is amazing. The shampoo has a high lather and the conditioner feels silky smooth. CONS - That I did not discover this Dove line sooner!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EMBL6WT2PBI2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
2,5,Reasonable price,"Love the shampoo & how soft my hair is after washing it",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WUMTI4BKHSVL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
2,5,Effective and affordable,"This is a great hair care line! Dove has formulas that clean and nourish hair at a drugstore price. To me, this performs better than the salon formulas that are sulfate-free. I alternate Dove with Garnier, Head n Shoulders, L‚ÄôOr√©al, or Herbal Essences and my hair has never looked or felt better. My one caveat with all Dove products: the scent is strong. It smells very clean, like laundry detergent, and it lasts all day long. I like it, but if you‚Äôre sensitive to fragrance, you might have to skip this line.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33Y1B9QGTT6P6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
2,4,Okay,"God value for money, but the smell is to strong for my taste, I had to put it on my spare bathroom",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TA2XU3UC09XU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8

3,5,"It works! Better than Head & Shoulders w/ Zinc Pyrithrone","Wow! Saved my scalp and hair! I have 1/2a/2b hair‚Äîfine, medium density, low porosity, and protein sensitive, with a very sensitive scalp. I used to use Head & Shoulders (I tried everything they offer) or Dove‚Äôs Dryness & Itch Relief dandruff shampoo. Both contain zinc pyrithione, and heavy-handed synthetic-smelling fragrance. Yuck. They both also left this gross residue on my hair, where my hair felt both dry and greasy. Double yuck. And my head would still get itchy by the next day! Triple yuck! So... not exactly a win-win for any part of my head. But I'd tried so many shampoos and these were the best options :( On the other hand, this CeraVe Hydrating Shampoo is fragrance-free, doesn‚Äôt contain zinc pyrithione and leaves my scalp itch-free all day, every day (!!!) and my hair clean and bouncy. I don‚Äôt know how they did it, but I‚Äôm so grateful!!! üôè You have no idea. I was going insane trying to find something that would work for me. I tried SO MANY shampoos and conditioners. I thought Target was going to ban me from how many I had tried and returned. CeraVe also worked well in both hard and soft water for me. Obviously it performed better in soft water, but in hard water I successfully paired it with a clarifying shampoo and chelator (as needed): L‚ÄôOr√©al‚Äôs Hard Water Clarifying Shampoo and MalibuC Hard Water packets. I had to be careful with that combo though. It did a great job at stripping my hair clean, but if I used it too often, it absolutely wrecked my scalp. I now have softened water, and I pair the CeraVe shampoo with L'Oreal's Curl Conditioner or L'Oreal's Restore Conditioner (aka their hard water conditioner) and that's been working very well for me. If I need to clarify every so often, I just shampoo twice with the CeraVe shampoo, and that does the trick. Anywho, I recommend giving this shampoo a shot! Hope it works for you too! And CeraVe.... DO NOT STOP MAKING THIS AND DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMULA.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NMH56G08NGJU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
3,5,"Finally, a Shampoo That Cleans Without Stripping ‚Äì Perfect for Sensitive Scalps","Calmed My Scalp, Balanced Oil, and Didn‚Äôt Trigger Hair Loss ‚Äì A Truly Gentle Formula That Works. I‚Äôve been using the CeraVe Gentle Hydrating Shampoo daily for about 4 weeks, and it‚Äôs exceeded expectations in every category that matters especially for someone like me with a sensitive scalp, thinning hair, and a tendency toward oiliness. Since switching to this shampoo, I‚Äôve noticed fewer hairs in the drain and on my brush, which is a big deal for me. My scalp feels healthier and less inflamed, which I suspect is helping with hair retention. I usually need to wash my hair daily because of oil buildup, but this shampoo has balanced my scalp‚Äôs oil production. My hair stays fresher for longer, and I can now go 2 full days without it looking greasy a first for me. There is no added fragrance, which I appreciate. It smells neutral almost clinical and fades immediately. Perfect if you‚Äôre sensitive to strong scents or want to avoid unnecessary irritants. Despite being low-foaming, it cleanses thoroughly. My scalp feels refreshed but not stripped. It removes sweat, light product buildup, and oil without leaving any residue. I‚Äôve had no itchiness or flakiness since using this consistently. I have color-treated hair, and this shampoo has not caused any fading or dullness. It‚Äôs sulfate-free, so it‚Äôs safe for colored hair. My hair still looks vibrant and feels soft. Even without a rich lather, my hair feels thoroughly clean after each wash. It rinses out easily and leaves no film or heaviness. I follow with a lightweight conditioner, and my hair feels smooth, hydrated, and manageable. This shampoo delivers on every front it‚Äôs gentle, effective, and safe for sensitive scalps and color-treated hair. It‚Äôs now my go-to for daily use. If you struggle with hair loss, excess oil, or irritation from traditional shampoos, this is worth trying.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I784LRLWFOQX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
3,5,No more sand like grit on scalp,"I kept getting sebum plugs or something that caused sand-like particles to grow on my scalp and show up when you run your nails across the roots of your hair/scalp (ie- scratch your itchy scalp). I‚Äôve dealt with this and an itchy scalp for decades. I‚Äôve tried all the dandruff, eczema, tea tre oil, baby and apple cinder shampoos. The closet I got was dumping apple cider vinegar on my scalp but then everything smells like it. Turns out using this product along with their conditioner and cleaning thoroughly EVERY DAY, resolves the problem. If you have long hair, make sure you scrub really good. And always shampoo twice in the shower. You want to remove the buildup. Also the shampoo itself is thick and amazing at leaving my hair so soft. It‚Äôs a great product . No fancy smells, but that‚Äôs what you need.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C2WNZA2YKGSU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
3,4,"Low foam, very gentle","I might have loved this shampoo more a few years ago, when I rarely shampooed my hair, cause so many shampoos irritated my scalp. It is very gentle, and doesn't foam much (which indicates there aren't many surfactants). I recommend this for anyone who has a sensitive scalp, because it does not have SLS and other harsh surfactants. For the price, it is absolutely worth trying. I also think this could help people with very oily hair -- as that oiliness is often caused by the scalp over-correcting for being stripped of its natural oils. Its thick consistency out of the bottle does make it harder to spread all over my hair, and it doesn't quite feel like it leaves my hair truly clean. Because it is so thick, I also end up using much more than other shampoos, though lately I have put on a pea-sized amount on each quadrant of my head, and that does seem to avoid wasting so much. My hair is short, though, and I assume on long hair and/or thick curls it might even be harder to work it in so it really gets to the scalp. It is unscented, which is great, but it does mean there is a bit of a soapy smell on it -- it's not bad, but it is not exactly something I enjoy. It definitely is color-safe -- even my semi-permanent fantasy colors stay put much more with this than with other shampoos. I do need to add a clarifying shampoo to my routine once a week with this shampoo, as it just doesn't seem it gets my hair very clean. I have to remove a lot of stuff from it, since now that it's short I have to use styling products. I think that I would have liked this much more when I still had long curly/wavy hair that I rarely applied any styling products to.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21E048G2ASTOT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
3,5,"A good wash","Surprised I like it so much. I generally trust Cerave as a brand. Ive used a lot of their lotions and washes, and they work how they say they will. I also appreciate that Dermatologists usually recommend Cerave products as well. AND Im also getting tired of how expensive salon quality shampoo/conditioner is getting these days. The affordability of this product, and the trust i have in the brand, swayed me to give this new shampoo a shot. And its surprisingly great! I mean i can do without hyaluronic acid in everything nowadays, but the full length of my hair does feel moisturized! And I feel like it built up a good lather without needing to use too much product, and my scalp feels good so far. its just a good basic shampoo, with typical shampoo smells, that cleans hair well, and is priced so everyone can benefit. And i like all that. I wash every 5-7 days and have thick, dense, frizzy, henna dyed, hispanic hair down to my mid back if that helps at all too.", https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E85BNPTP1ODM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
3,5,"Great Hydrating Shampoo","Not much to say besides that it's a great shampoo and is definitely a little different than others I've had. It cleans the hair well but there is a noticable amount of shine, softness, and light weight to my hair after rinsing. I live in an area with super hard water and this helps keep my scalp and hair healthy effectively.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ITQE3BCEMSH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
4,5,"A good buy, top tier product","Removes grease and is easy to use, leaves your hair smelling amazing and feeling soft.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N7QWX77RYLEW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
4,5,Shiny healthy hair,"Written by account holders wife. I love this shampoo and conditioner and I‚Äôm really picky about hair products usually going with very high end products from my hair salon or ulta. But this is one of the exceptions- I just love the way it makes my hair feel. It conditions well without leaving it heavy and weighing it down. I have colored naturally curly baby fine hair so I need special products. This works and gives my hair a gloss look and keeps it healthy and keeps my color healthy between trips to salon. The price is great and I recently broke my dominant arm so the pump has come in handy since I only have use of one hand but honestly I will stick to this since it was getting hard for me to squeeze the bottles with my arthritis. Shampoo quality is great. Moisture level is on point. Leaves your hair soft, shiny, beautiful. If you are looking for a shampoo and conditioner to keep your color or non color treated hair shiny and healthy- this is it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TRTYMLZZI94A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
4,5,Excellent Shampoo & Fantastic Subscribe & Save Deal!,"We've been using the Pantene Pro-V Smooth & Sleek Shampoo and Conditioner set for over a year now, and it continues to impress us. This is a very good shampoo and an even better deal when you subscribe and save. The product consistently delivers great results. Our hair always feels smooth, looks shiny, and the follicles feel rejuvenated and healthy. It truly lives up to its '72 Hour Smoothness' claim, helping to control frizz and leaving our hair feeling fantastic. I highly recommend this product, especially in this larger size, as it truly lasts a long time, making the subscribe and save option even more economical. If you're looking for consistent quality and a great value, look no further!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSZ7ASG46T114/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
4,5,Great shampoo & conditioner,"Been using this product for years! Makes my hair look healthy, shiny and smooth. Will only buy Pantene. Works well and reasonably priced. I should be a spokesperson. lol",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R191MHEIROZEG6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
4,4,Luxury-Level Softness Without the Luxury Price,"I‚Äôve used everything from drugstore staples to salon exclusives but this one truly holds its own especially for dry or color-treated hair like mine. From the first wash I could feel the difference. The shampoo has a rich velvety texture that glides through the hair without resistance. It produces a dense creamy lather that coats the scalp and strands evenly. Unlike some shampoos that just sit in one spot this one spreads easily and I noticed it was easier to set and adjust the angle when applying it especially with wet hands. That made the whole process faster and cleaner. The conditioner is equally impressive thick smooth and instantly softening. It doesn‚Äôt just coat the hair it penetrates enough to make a difference. Rinsing it out leaves my hair feeling soft not slippery or waxy. The Miracle Rescue Shot is concentrated but lightweight. After applying it to my drier ends they felt noticeably restored stronger smoother and more defined. My hair stayed hydrated and soft for a full 72 hours just like they claimed. The formula helped reduce frizz and made detangling incredibly easy. My color looked fresh and the product didn‚Äôt dull or strip it. The fragrance is light clean and long-lasting without being overpowering. I got salon-level results at a fraction of the cost. Rich lather with great spreadability ideal for thorough cleansing. Easier to handle and apply than many shampoos I‚Äôve used. Massive size 52.8 oz total excellent value for daily use. The Miracle Shot gives a noticeable moisture and strength boost. Hair feels clean soft and manageable without buildup. It contains sulfates and silicones which I usually limit though the benefits outweighed that for me. Bottles are large may not fit smaller storage spaces. I noticed mild buildup on finer sections after several uses a clarifying shampoo helped. For extremely damaged or protein-starved hair I still needed an occasional deep treatment.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLLHQNW8IPD31/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8
